interactive software application using Python to control HP’s 3D metal jet printers to make it easier and faster for the operators to excavate the printed parts. These 3D printers are running Ubuntu/Linux operating system, and I had to add Tcl/Shell commands to my Python script to be able to control them. I later added my application to a Raspberry Pi, which was connected to a touch-screen display. The Raspberry Pi was communicating with HP’s 3D printers via a RS232 serial cable.
